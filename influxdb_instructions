Writing to InfluxDB through Python (need Python library):

	1.	Line protocol --> "measurement,tag_key=tag_value field_key=field_value timestamp"
	      ⁃	Timestamp (in UTC) is automatically generated, but you might want to specify in case of lag between time of measurement and time of writing to database
	      ⁃	Sample line protocol: "gyro,location=lab x=0.12345 1556892576842902000"
	2.	Bucket is sensors
	3.	Refer to /mychai/sn2influxdb.ipynb for example on formatting data into line protocol + writing to InfluxDB


How to run InfluxDB UI on starfire:

	1.	ssh into starfire server
	2.	Enter ssh -N -L 8086:128.91.46.170:8086 user@starfire.physics.upenn.edu into local computer
	3.	Open localhost:8086 in browser
	4.	Go to Boards tab and select Gyro Test
	5.	Select Seqnum Test cell to view in more detail
	      ⁃	Can be done using tabs, or by entering a Flux query


Sample Flux query:

from(bucket:"sensors")
  |> range(start: -1h)
  |> filter(fn: (r) =>
    r._measurement == "test" and
    r._field == "test_seqnum" and
    r.location == "lab"
  )
  |> aggregateWindow(every: 1s, fn: distinct)
